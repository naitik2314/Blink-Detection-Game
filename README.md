### Gist about the project
In my school days, me and my friends, used to play a lot of truth and dare, and I used to take a dare, well it was intentional, see I had a crush on this beautiful girl in my class, and my friends used to always dare me to stare her for 2 minutes straight, and I am so damn emotional, I used to blush in like 15 seconds, so I decided to up my game, by coding Blink Detection Game, where it times about how much you can stare, I used to stare at her picture(Don't think I am cheap), I was a school kid back then. Hope this code helps you up your stare game. And yes, she is still my crush.
